# Pretty Logs

Welcome to pretty-logs.  pretty-logs is a JavaScript logging tool.  The goal is to allow developers to create more informative logs.

## Motivation

I created this library for two reasons:

1.  I wanted to practice creating and maintaining an open source project.
2.  If Reason 1 was to create an open source project, that project has to have a subject.  I wanted it to be something small, but something that would be useful to me.  It just so happens that the contents of this library is something I found myself copying from project to project and each time I wished that I could just npm install it.  

The above is why I created this.
