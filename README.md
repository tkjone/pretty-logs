# Pretty Logs

[![styled with prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/styled_with-prettier-ff69b4.svg)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

Welcome to `pretty-logs`.  `pretty-logs` is a JavaScript logging tool.

**WARNING:**

This library is super rough and untested.  Please do not use in production until I actually have the opportunity to clean things up.

## Motivation

This library was created because I became tired of moving my custom rolled logging library from project-to-project.
I wanted this to be an easy way to use this minimal library in my future projects and pick up on the improvements I make as i go.  I also
wanted to work with open source projects and attempt to maintain my own.

## Contributing

I am always happy to have people contribute to this project.  Please start by reading this projects code of conduct.

### Development

We use [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier#badge) on this project.  We have git commit hooks, a pre-commit hook, which runs when you run `git commit` locally.  At this point, prettier is going to run and write in place.
