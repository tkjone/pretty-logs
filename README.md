# Pretty Logs

Welcome to `pretty-logs`.  `pretty-logs` is a JavaScript logging tool.

**WARNING:**

This library is super rough and untested.  Please do not use in production until I actually have the opportunity to clean things up.

## Motivation

This library was created because I became tired of moving my custom rolled logging library from project-to-project.
I wanted this to be an easy way to use this minimal library in my future projects and pick up on the improvements I make as i go.  I also
wanted to work with open source projects and attempt to maintain my own.

## Contributing

I am always happy to have people contribute to this project.  Please start by reading this projects code of conduct.
